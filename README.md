Malayalam Voice Studio 🎙️🔊
Welcome to Malayalam Voice Studio. This is a modern, high-performance web application designed to convert Malayalam text into lifelike speech using the advanced Sarvam AI engine.

🔴 LIVE DEMO:https://jeessunny.github.io/Malayalam-TTS/

🤖 Made with Google Gemini
This entire project was designed, architected, and coded using Google Gemini.
Code Generation: 100% of the HTML, Tailwind CSS styling, and complex React logic (including the audio chunking and merging algorithms) was generated by Gemini.
Problem Solving: Critical features like the "Unlimited Text" chunking system and the robust mobile download fix were diagnosed and implemented via AI prompts.

✨ Features
🚀 Unlimited Text Support: Includes a smart chunking engine that automatically splits long text into smaller parts and stitches the audio back together seamlessly.

🎙️ Voice Studio: Choose from a curated list of high-quality Indian voices, including:
Anushka (Soft & Clear)
Amartya (Deep & Resonant)
Janaki (Narrative)

🎛️ Audio Mixing Console: Fine-tune your output with professional controls:
Speed (Pace): Adjust speaking rate from 0.5x to 1.5x.
Pitch: Modify tone from Deep to High.
Loudness: Control the gain/volume.
Quality: Switch between 8kHz (Phone) and 16kHz (Studio).

💾 Robust Download Manager: Optimized logic ensures generated audio saves correctly as .wav files on both desktop and mobile devices.

📱 Mobile First Design: A fully responsive, app-like interface built with Tailwind CSS.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 & React: Built as a generic "Single File Application" using React via CDN (no build steps required).
Tailwind CSS: For rapid, utility-first styling.
Sarvam AI API: Powered by the bulbul:v2 model for state-of-the-art Malayalam synthesis.
Lucide React: For crisp, vector-based iconography.
🚀 How to Run Locally
Download the index.html file from this repository.
Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Brave).
Enjoy! No npm install, no build servers, and no installations are required.
Note: You will need an active internet connection as the app loads React and Tailwind from CDNs.
Disclaimer: This is a fan-made project created for educational purposes. It utilizes the Sarvam AI API for synthesis.
